# Enterprise ECS Version - Production Powerhouse (400 lines)

This version represents the **peak of infrastructure complexity**, showcasing enterprise-grade ECS deployment with comprehensive observability and production hardening.

## Enterprise Features

- **Advanced ECS Configuration** with detailed task definitions
- **Multi-AZ High Availability** with redundancy
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** with custom CloudWatch dashboards
- **Production Security** with least-privilege IAM roles
- **Cost Optimization** strategies (single NAT gateway for dev)
- **Container Health Checks** at multiple levels

## Architecture

```
Internet → ALB (Multi-AZ) → ECS Tasks (Private Subnets)
                              ↓
                    CloudWatch Dashboard
                    ├── ECS Metrics
                    ├── ALB Metrics  
                    ├── Container Logs
                    └── Auto Scaling Events
```

## Production Hardening

### Security
- Task execution role with minimal permissions
- ECR image vulnerability scanning
- Private subnet deployment only
- Security group restrictions

### Reliability  
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Health checks at container and load balancer level
- Graceful container shutdown handling
- Rolling deployment strategy

### Observability
- Detailed CloudWatch dashboards
- Container insights enabled
- Structured logging with log streams
- Custom metrics and alarms

### Cost Management
- Environment-based resource sizing
- ECR lifecycle policies (keep last 5 images)  
- Single NAT gateway for dev environments
- Right-sized compute resources

## Deployment

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install
pulumi config set appName "my-qr-app"
pulumi config set environment "dev"
pulumi up
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
appName: "qr-code-creator"           # Application name
environment: "dev"                   # dev/staging/prod
containerPort: 8080                  # Application port
```

## Infrastructure Complexity

This version demonstrates:
- **400 lines** of carefully crafted infrastructure code
- **20+ AWS resources** working together
- **Production-grade** monitoring and alerting
- **Enterprise security** best practices

## The Peak Complexity Problem

While this setup provides enterprise capabilities, it suffers from:
- High maintenance overhead
- Steep learning curve
- Difficult to replicate across projects  
- Knowledge silos (infrastructure experts required)
- Long deployment times

**This is exactly the problem that components solve** - providing the same production capabilities with 95% less code.
